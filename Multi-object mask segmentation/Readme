Train a segmentation model with multiple classes(objects). I have used YOLOv8 model for this purpose
Replace the trained file path to your own model
The output will be displayed with only masks of each objects in a white background/colored background
Here, the segmentation is performed for 5 objects. For more objects, increase the color coding.
